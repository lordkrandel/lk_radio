Welcome to ``lk_radio`` contributor's guide.

Clone the repository
--------------------

#. Create an user account on |the repository service| if you do not already have one.
#. Fork the project repository_: click on the *Fork* button near the top of the
   page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on |the repository service|.
#. Clone this copy to your local disk::

    git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/lk_radio.git
    cd lk_radio

#. You should run::

    pip install -U pip setuptools -e .

   to be able to import the package under development in the Python REPL.


Implement your changes
----------------------

#. Create a branch to hold your changes::

    git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. Never work on the main branch!

#. Start your work on this branch. Don't forget to add docstrings_ to new
   functions, modules and classes, especially if they are part of public APIs.

#. Add yourself to the list of contributors in ``AUTHORS.rst``.

#. When youâ€™re done editing, do::

    git add <MODIFIED FILES>
    git commit

   to record your changes in git_.
